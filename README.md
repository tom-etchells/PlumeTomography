# PlumeTomography
Simulations, code, and scripts related to the PhD thesis "Tomographic Reconstruction of Volcanic Ash Plumes Using Simulated Satellite Image Data"

# TODO
  - ~~Actually upload relevant code and scripts, including Blender simulation files~~
  - Upload results/renders/reconstructions, need to optimise file sizes here a bit, esp. the Blender renders
  - Refactor code to improve readability and remove some redundant or depricated scripts
  - Update comments and add documentation
